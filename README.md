		- E.g. low cost airline keeping operating an aircraft past the maximum legal replacement date of a part
	- High safety risk related to bogus parts
	- High safety risk related to aircraft operation out of specified/legal conditions
		- E.g. airline/airport allowing take off beyond maximum allowed take weight (to transport more cargo and save money although illegal)
	- Manual and paper based process

		- costs savings + process efficiency
		- protection against penalties from authority
		- protection against reputation damages
	- Automation possibilites if combined with IoT devices
		- Digital Twin ordering its "self-replacement" on behalf of the Airline

-  Tech Stack chosen: [Evan.network](https://evan.network/)
- Context/Industry: aviation supply chain, especially after sales business
- Customers/stakeholders
	- Airlines
	- Maintenance and Repair Organization (MRO)
	- Spare parts suppliers/manufacturers
	- Aviation Authorities
- Problems/pain points to solve
	- Long life cycles (50 years before aircraft retirement): how to track  and trust the operations history and all the ownership transfers over such a long time? How to audit it?
	- High safety risk related to wrong or late maintenance operations
		- E.g. low cost airline keeping operating an aircraft past the maximum legal replacement date of a part
	- High safety risk related to bogus parts
	- High safety risk related to aircraft operation out of specified/legal conditions
		- E.g. airline/airport allowing take off beyond maximum allowed take off weight (to transport more cargo and save money although illegal)
	- Manual and paper based process
- Benefits
	- Safer aircraft operations
	- Streamlined and better scheduled maintenance process: perform maintenance operations neither too early nor too late but at the right time
		- costs savings + process efficiency
		- avoid fines
		- prevent reputation and brand damage
	- Automation possibilities if combined with IoT devices: digital twin ordering its "self-replacement" on behalf of the Airline
- Solution: front-end client connecting to evan.network and allowing customers to perform their specific jobs
	- Airline
		- Check parts installed and their properties (e.g next planned maintenance operation date)
		- Transfer ownership of aircraft to another Airline
		- Check history of flights
		- Request/schedule maintenance operation
	- MRO
		- Perform maintenance task
		- Order spare part
	- Supplier
		- Deliver spare part
	- Authority
		- View history of maintenance operations
		- View hisotry of aircraft flights
